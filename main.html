              A car is a four-wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. It
              typically runs on gasoline or diesel. The engine converts fuel
              into mechanical power to move the car. The transmission controls
              the speed and direction. Cars come in various sizes and types to
              suit different needs. They have seats for passengers and storage
              space for goods. Wheels and tires provide mobility and traction on
              the road. Modern cars often come with advanced features like air
              conditioning and infotainment systems. Safety features like
              airbags and ABS are standard in most cars. Cars have become an
              integral part of modern life, providing convenience and
              independence for individuals and families.
